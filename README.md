<p><b>Usage:</b>
<p>Enter the variable values, confirm the settings, and click OK. A script will be created at the destination location. Once the script is generated, open a new board and run the script.  You can use the source board if you set the origin so it won't conflict with the original board.
<p><b>Variables:</b></p>
<p><b>Origin</b> - where to start the panel array.  Usually (0,0) or (0,0) plus the height of the current board.</p>
<p><b>Columns</b> - Number of boards to make in the X direction.</p>
<p><b>Rows</b> - Number of boards to make in the Y direction.</p>
<p><b>X Spacing</b> - Distance between boards in X direction.</p>
<p><b>Y Spacing</b> - Distance between boards in Y direction.</p>
